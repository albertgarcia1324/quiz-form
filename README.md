Hi!

This is a quiz form that I have completed from Web Dev Simplified's course for JavaScript! 

This was a fun little project that I hope to add more front end questions in the future to help junior developers quiz themselves on the basics of web development.

For this project there are only 3 questions, that when correct answer is selected turns green and turns red for incorrect answers. 
If all 3 questions are answered correctly, there is a setTimeout() with an alert stating all questions were answered correctly!
I learned a lot including adding and removing class lists for incorrect, correct and active classes. Also, I like the way instructor 
writes clean code and good use of forEach() and If/Else statements.
